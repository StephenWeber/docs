# Welcome

[Atomist][www] is a software delivery platform built for modern applications.
We re-imagined how software delivery should work and how you use it. The result
is a powerful event-driven approach, with an integrated data model across all
stages of delivery, a programmable interface to automate delivery in code, and
native ChatOps integration to make delivery more collaborative. 

Atomist enables [Self-Service Software Delivery][sssd] so that you can focus on
creating great software, automatically delivered by a powerful platform that
understands your projects.
